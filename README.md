ArkC Golang implementation
============================

### What is ArkC?

ArkC is a proxy designed against detection of Great Firewall of China. For more information, see repos under [@projectarkc](https://github.com/projectarkc), which contain original python implementations.

### Why (re)implement it in Golang?

1. Original closed-source Golang implementation is not well architectured and hard to maintain.
2. Golang is still good for continuous development and compatible with Google App Engine (arkc-gae)

### Development status

Work in progress. Current version has no support for Google App Engine deployment.
